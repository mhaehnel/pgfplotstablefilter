This is a latex package that extends pgfplotstable to provide a filtering
mechanism. This is currently quite crude, but should be extensible.

Please beware that this package relies on internal datastructure details of
pgfplotstable and the pgfplotsliststructure. Should these change then this
package might break.

See demo.tex for an explanation how it works. It's really quite simple
